    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common application for AR, ARMA, and ARIMA models is inventory planning. Planning inventory for a small shop can be difficult enough, but you've just been hired to plan inventory for a _big_ store - Walmart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be analyzing weekly Walmart sales data over a two year period from 2010 to 2012. The data is separated by store and by department, but you should focus on analyzing one store for simplicity. Your supervisor has set out the following goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Record any observed trends in the data.\n",
    "2. Produce a trained model to predict future sales numbers.\n",
    "3. Include useful AND COMMENT ON how graphs (ACF, PACF) impact your modelling decisions throughout your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try your best to tune your model. It can be difficult, but don't worry - time series analysis is a difficult and specialized topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assemble observations and graphs as well as timeseries models in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [ARMA Example](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/tsa_arma_0.html)\n",
    "2. [ARMA Models for TSA](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Autoregressive-Moving-Average-ARMA-p-q-Models-for-Time-Series-Analysis-Part-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always be looking for ways to reduce redundancy in your code, improve consistency in your output, and make it easier for others to follow your work! Functions are a huge part of this endeavor!\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on this lab, you may try a number of $p$, $q$, and $d$ values to best account for your data. Because you will likely be repeating yourself, it is useful to create functions that declutter your workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You may want to create a wrapper around the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to provide both results and context for the output.\n",
    " - You may find value in a combined ACF & PACF function.\n",
    " - You may find it cleaner to build a function to make residual graphs and print out MSE all at once."
