<!--- Unit and sequence information. This template is an instructor-facing description for a given activity or lab. --->

We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

In this lab, we're going to focus on steps exploring data, building models and evaluating the models we build.

This lab uses a chronic kidney disease dataset. You may find [this article](./chronic_kidney_disease.pdf) informative background reading. It's a bit shorter than five pages with about a full page of references and a decent number of graphs that take up space. Even though we haven't seen support vector machines (yet!), it's a good read and shockingly quick for an academic journal article.

## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
