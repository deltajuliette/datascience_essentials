<!--- Unit and sequence information. This template is an instructor-facing description for a given activity or lab. --->

This lab walks you through using discrete distributions to perform calculations about loot boxes in a video game.
- This lab is more mathematical in nature than the last lab. Therefore, this may take substantially longer or substantially shorter than the previous lab, depending on your skills and your interests.
- As you noticed with the last lab, when the lab is assigned, you may not be able to complete all pieces of it. That's okay, and that's intentional! We release the lab as soon as you're able to complete some of it so that you have as much time as possible to work on it.

## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->
