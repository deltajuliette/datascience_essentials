## Business Case

You are an analyst at a "scrappy" online gaming company that specializes in remakes of last year's fads.

Your boss, who runs the product development team, is convinced that Pokemon Go's fatal flaw was that you had to actually move around outside. She has designed mock-ups for a new game called Pokemon Stay. In this version players still need to move, but just from website to website. Pokemon gyms are now popular online destinations, and catching Pokemon in the "wild" simply requires browsing the internet for hours in the comfort of your home.

## Difficulty Disclaimer
When the lab is assigned, you may not be able to complete all pieces of it. That's okay, and that's intentional! We release the lab as soon as you're able to complete some of it so that you have as much time as possible to work on it.

## Directions

Follow the question prompts and use base Python to create data structures and functions for the Pokemon Stay game.

We will be looking for the following things:

- For coding questions, Python code that gives the correct output for each question.
- For written questions, clear answers in Markdown cells.

---

## Requirements

- Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.
- Students should demonstrate proficiency with:

  - Command of basic Python data structures
  - Command of basic Python syntax and control flow

### Useful Resources

- This draws heavily on Python concepts from the first couple days of class -- review those lectures!

- For some questions, you may want to brush up on [list comprehensions](http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/).
