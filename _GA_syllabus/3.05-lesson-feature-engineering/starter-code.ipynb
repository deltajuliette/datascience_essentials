    "- Linear regression is a way for us to relate some dependent variable $Y$ to independent variables $X_1$,$\\ldots$,$X_p$.\n",
    "- We might write this out in one of the following two forms:\n",

    "There are four assumptions to the simple linear regression model and five assumptions to the multiple linear regression model.\n",

    "1. **Linearity:** $Y$ is linearly related to $X_i$ for all $i$.<br>\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Each residual $\\varepsilon_i$ is independent of $\\varepsilon_j$ for all $i\\neq j$.<br>\n",
    "3. **Normality:** The errors (residuals) follow a Normal distribution with mean 0.<br>\n",
    "4. **Equality of Variance:** The errors (residuals) should have a roughly consistent pattern, regardless of the value of $X_i$. (There should be no discernible relationship between $X_i$ and the residuals.)<br>\n",
    "5. **Independence Part II:** $X_i$ is independent of $X_j$ for all $i\\neq j$.\n",

    "- If I use degrees Fahrenheit to predict how much a substance will expand or inches of rain to predict traffic accidents, people outside the United States may have a tougher time understanding my work.\n",
    "- If I use straight line distance (as the crow flies) between two locations, my estimated time of arrival in a taxi or a Lyft is going to be pretty bad.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. 'Applied machine learning' is basically feature engineering.\" - Andrew Ng\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature engineering** is the term broadly applied to the creation and manipulation of features (variables) used in machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless we're working with the same data over and over again, this isn't something we can automate. It will require creativity and a good, thorough understanding of our data.\n",

    "#### The Process of Data Science\n",
    "1. Data Gathering\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning/Munging\n",
    "3. EDA\n",
    "4. Modeling\n",
    "5. Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering will straddle all five of these steps, but mostly focus on steps 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [The Process of Feature Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUToKxEAUA)\n",
    "1. Brainstorming or testing features.\n",
    "2. Deciding what features to create.\n",
