## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

*After this lessons, students will be able to:*

- Define and describe sampling distribution.
- Define, describe and compute standard error of the mean.
- Describe the Central Limit Theorem.

## Student Requirements

*Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:*

1. Iterate and write functions in Python
2. Explain difference between statistics and parameters

## Additional Resources

<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->
