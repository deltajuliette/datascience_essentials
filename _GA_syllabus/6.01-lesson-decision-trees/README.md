## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

1. Understand the intuition behind decision trees.
2. Calculate Gini.
3. Describe how decision trees use gini to make decisions.
4. Fit, generate predictions from, and evaluate decision tree models.
5. Interpret and tune `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `ccp_alpha`.
6. Visualize a decision tree.
