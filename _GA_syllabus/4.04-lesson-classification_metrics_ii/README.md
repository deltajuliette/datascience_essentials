## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
- Calculate various classification model evaluation metrics.
- Describe the inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity.
- Understand what the ROC shows and interpret ROC AUC.

---

## Student Requirements

*Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:*

1. Define true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.
2. Construct a confusion matrix.
3. Calculate accuracy, misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
4. Compare the "cost" or "badness" of false positives versus false negatives.
