## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

1. Distinguish between regression and classification problems.
2. Understand how logistic regression is similar to and different from linear regression.
3. Fit, generate predictions from, and evaluate a logistic regression model in `sklearn`.
4. Understand how to interpret the coefficients of logistic regression.
5. Know the benefits of logistic regression as a classifier.
