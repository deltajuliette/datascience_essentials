    "Logistic regression is a natural bridge to connect regression and classification.\n",
    "- Logistic regression is the most common binary classification algorithm.\n",
    "- Because it is a regression model, logistic regression will predict continuous values.\n",
    "    - Logistic regression will predict continuous probabilities between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - Example: What is the probability that someone shows up to vote?\n",
    "- However, logistic regression almost always operates as a classification model.\n",
    "    - Logistic regression will use these continuous predictions to classify something as 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - Example: Based on the predicted probability, do we predict that someone votes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll only be reviewing the binary outcome case with two classes, but logistic regression can be generalized to predicting outcomes with 3 or more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some examples of when logistic regression could be used:**\n",
    "- Will a user will purchase a product, given characteristics like income, age, and number of family members?\n",
    "- Does this patient have a specific disease based on their symptoms?\n",
    "- Will a person default on their loan?\n",

    "- Given one's GPA and the prestige of a college, will a student be admitted to a specific graduate program?\n",
