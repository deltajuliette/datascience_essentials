## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

1. Understand the Beta Distribution
2. Describe the concept of "conjugacy" and "conjugate priors" in Bayesian statistics
3. Set up an example of the Beta-Binomial model using a midterm election example
4. Calculate the Maximum Likelihood Estimate
5. Use the Beta-Binomial model to build our example in a Bayesian framework
