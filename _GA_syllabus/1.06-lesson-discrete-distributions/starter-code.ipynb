    "Continuous random variables, on the other hand, have outcomes which are not countable. Say, for example, $T$ is a random variable representing the temperature at noon. There are not exact temperature outcomes with associated probabilities of occurrence â€“ the number of outcomes is infinite. The probabilities of _ranges of values_ are calculated as areas under the **probability density function (pdf)**, which is the probability function associated with continuous variables.\n",
