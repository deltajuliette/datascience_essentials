## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
1. Describe what a loss function is.
2. Define regularization.
3. Describe and differentiate LASSO and Ridge regularization.
4. Understand how regularization affects the bias-variance tradeoff.
5. Implement LASSO regression and Ridge regression.

## Student Requirements

*Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:*

1. Define, interpret and calculate loss/error metrics MSE and R-squared.
2. Construct and interpret regression models in `sklearn` and `statsmodels`.
3. Summarize the bias-variance tradeoff.
4. Identify causes of error due to bias and error due to variance.
5. Summarize and implement feature scaling.
