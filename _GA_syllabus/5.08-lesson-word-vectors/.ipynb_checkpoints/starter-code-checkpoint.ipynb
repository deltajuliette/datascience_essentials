This means that the same words (e.g. \"apple\" in a sentence about fruit and \"Apple\" in a sentence about computers) can be represented by different vectors based on their contexts.

However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require that the sequential data be processed in order. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the Transformer does not need to process the beginning of it before the end. Due to this feature, the Transformer allows for much more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduced training times.  \n",
