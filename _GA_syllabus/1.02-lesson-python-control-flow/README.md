## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Starter Code | [Link](./starter-code.ipynb)|
| Exercises | 5 challenging exercises | [Link](./exercises.ipynb)
| Lesson Solutions | Solution Code | [Link](./solution-code/solution-code.ipynb)|
| Exercise Solutions | Solution code for 5 challenging exercises | [Link](./exercises-solutions.ipynb)

## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

- Explore `Python` control flow and conditional programming.
- Implement `for` and `while` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `if, else` conditional statements.
- Demonstrate error-handling using `try, except` statements.
- Combine control flow and conditional statements to solve the classic "FizzBuzz" code challenge.

## Student Requirements

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this lesson? This includes lists of skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to**:

- Know python data types: string, int, float, boolean, tuple, list, dictionary

## Lesson Outline

<!--- This section outlines the lesson plan with relevant sections and subsections, providing both the total time required as well as suggestions for timing in each subsection --->

> Total Time: 90 min

- Conditional statements (`if`/`else` statements)
    - Eat some broccoli ice cream
    - Get feedback on our health test
- For Loops
    - Greet our instructors
    - Loop through a range
    - Loop through unpacked tuples
- While Loops
    - Creating a loop that stops randomly
    - Create an infinite loop
- Error Handling
    - Stop ourselves from accidentally dividing by zero, which would really wreak havoc

## Additional Resources

<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->
