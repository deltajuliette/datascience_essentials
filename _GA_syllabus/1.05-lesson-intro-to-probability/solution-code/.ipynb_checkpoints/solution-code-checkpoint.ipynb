    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with limits, that's okay! \n",
    "- The idea is that while we can't actually run the experiment an infinite number of times, if we ran the experiment 1,000 times, then 1,000,000 times, then 1,000,000,000 times, can we get an understanding of what $P(A)$ is?\n",
    "- Limits are fundamentally important to *how* lots of machine learning and statistics work, but we're almost always able to do our work without getting into the weeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we can find probabilities exactly by hand... but that quickly gets complicated. Instead, let's *estimate* $P(A)$ by leveraging Python to run some large number of experiments and seeing how frequently $A$ occurs:\n",
